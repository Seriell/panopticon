# About Fork

Since the original Panopticon project is no longer maintained, I have decided to pick it up where it left off with Ruby/Discordrb, and enhancing and maintaining it (As well as including the features the Python version had.)
All credit goes to the original creator.

# Panopticon

A user-focused message logger for Discord, a la the built-in logging present in many IRC clients.

## Dependencies

* Ruby 2.1 or greater
* [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb)
* [Zaru](https://github.com/madrobby/zaru)

## Installation, setup, and usage

* Clone the repo
* Copy config.rb.example to config.rb and edit it
* ./run.rb

### Notes

You may periodically see a message in your terminal along the lines of:

`The bot does not have permission to do this!`

followed by a string of errors.

This relates to discordrb, the library Panopticon utilizes, and the way User objects are managed.
